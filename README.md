# Easyaccess lib

##### Don't expect to find something useful here I was just building my knowledge in go and github actions.

##### Talking seriously :
##### This is a library where you can find shortcuts for long commands like ``` fmt.Println(blabla)```
##### i was just so lazy to write all that so I developed my own shortcut ```p.Ln(blabla)``` => see the difference :D


### How to use
```go
go get github.com/YahyaQandel/easyaccess
```

### Run tests
```go
go test
```

### build and clean mod cache
